## Criteria

There are many, many variables involved in choosing a good keyboard, but for those who don't want to go down the [rabbit hole](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/our-favorite-mechanical-keyboards/), it's actually very easy to dramatically improve your typing experience.

Mainly, get a mechanical keyboard. They're available in all price ranges and are a step above a standard keyboard in how they feel and how accurate they are to type on. All of the recommendations here are mechanical keyboards.

The second consideration is how long of a keyboard travel you want (how much do you want to press to type a letter). Chiclet keyboards, such as those sold by Apple, have the shortest travel; however, they can cause stress injuries on fingers and aren't recommended. Logitech makes a keyboard with a very short travel and just a little bit more padding. The short travel can improve your typing speed. However, many people prefer keyboards with standard amounts of travel and can type much faster than you or I. This is a matter of comfort and personal preference.

## Recommendation

These are the two I own and can recommend. They're very solid examples of the main types of keyboards.

The Das Keyboard Professional is an elevated version of a standard keyboard. The vast majority of people, myself included, advise the one with the soft tactile Cherry MX Brown switches. If you really want super click-y switches, you can select that option as well, the Cherry MX Blue. For a sensitive keyboard with a shorter travel distance (which can improve typing speed), the Logitech G915 TKL is an elevated version of a chiclet keyboard, with a softer yet still precise feel. It's wireless, though personally, I use it wired. You never know when having both a wireless keyboard and mouse will come in handy, so it's certainly not a drawback. It is known for its incredibly low latency, which can be important for both typing and keyboard navigation.

I own both of them and gently prefer the Logitech. I highly advise buying both, being careful with the packaging, and returning the one you like less.

> ### Rabbit Hole
> This guide should in no way be considered a definitive guide to mechanical keyboards. See [this article](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/our-favorite-mechanical-keyboards/) for an accessible introduction. Most options cost between $120-200 and will work great, though you can go more expensive (normally for fun, not productivity). If you have very specific keyboard preferences, know that there is a product out there that will get it right; you'll just need to do research and try more things out.

## Budget Recommendation
The Keychron C1 is a great starter mechanical keyboard that is likely a significant upgrade from whatever you're using now.

## Setup

Make sure to adjust your desk so that your arms hang at 90 degrees while typing.

Some keyboards allow you to adjust the angle from flat to raised in the back. Use what feels most comfortable to you. Also, consider a [wrist rest](https://www.amazon.com/Wrist-Rests). Personally, I don't like them, but for some people, they can be critical in avoiding carpal tunnel.
