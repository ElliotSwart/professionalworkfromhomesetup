## Considerations

The most important thing, from a productivity perspective, is that your mouse should not suck. This may sound glib, but it's the most critical criterion. Plenty of programmers fight their mouse daily because it isn't sufficiently responsive, gets stuck or skips across the mousepad, or just otherwise doesn't do what you want it to do.

Criteria for a good mouse include:
- Sensor: how accurately does the mouse track, and on what surfaces?
- Ergonomics: how well does it fit in your hand?
- Scroll wheel: how quickly and accurately can you scroll to where you want to go?

There is one clear winner across every review site, and also in my personal opinion: the Logitech MX Master 3S. This would be a good place to spend if you can afford it.

## Recommendation

For most users, the Logitech MX Master 3S is the only mouse you should consider. It's smooth, with a sensor that can track accurately on almost any surface. It feels good and precise in your hand. Its scroll wheel is one of the best you can find. Finally, it has some additional productivity features that power users may find helpful.

## Budget Recommendation

The Logitech M720 Triathlon does not suck. In fact, it's pretty good. It's a productivity mouse, so it's somewhat optimized for the needs of programmers. It's almost certainly better than your current mouse, but worse than the Logitech MX Master 3S in every way. It is, however, a fantastic deal.
