## Criteria
In order to set up a reliable internet connection, you need a router and a Wi-Fi system. The Wi-Fi system talks with the Wi-Fi chips in your devices, such as laptops and smartphones. It joins them all into the same local network, but that doesn't connect them to the internet directly. For that, you need a router. Your router is generally attached to your modem and your Wi-Fi system via ethernet cables. It gives devices IP addresses, routes network connections to and from the right devices, and provides internet to your local network (which includes all the devices connected through Wi-Fi).

 (TODO: What is a router? What is an access point???) 
While it's technically possible to separate your router and Wi-Fi system, the best products for home use combine both. Reliable routing is critical to reliable internet. Wi-Fi must also be delivered across your home, even if there are many connected devices. Often, when your internet is dropped or slowed, it's the fault of your Wi-Fi setup. 

Wi-Fi 6e is the latest stable Wi-Fi standard, and it's also the most reliable. It's backward-compatible, too. Your Wi-Fi setup should be Wi-Fi 6e or Wi-Fi 6.

The best Wi-Fi systems on the market today, whether you have an apartment or a large house, are mesh Wi-Fi products from Amazon, Google, and NetGear. Mesh Wi-Fi systems are composed of multiple wirelessly connected nodes. One node is placed next to the modem, and the rest of them can be distributed throughout the house. A very helpful feature to look for when purchasing mesh Wi-Fi is the ability to provide internet over ethernet from non-wired nodes. You can wire it into your docking station or a network switch (TODO: link to a description of a docking station), and it can provide significantly more reliable internet than your laptop's Wi-Fi card. I recommend buying enough nodes to get good coverage of your space, erring on the side of too many if possible.

Both the _Recommendation_ and the _Budget Recommendation_ come from the Eero product line. While the Eero has generally good reviews, there are more highly reviewed products from NetGear. With that said, reviewers tend to focus on benchmarks: the maximum speed, the absolute lowest latency, and so on. The key differentiating factor of Eero products is their reliability, largely due to the high quality of their software. In practice, most good mesh Wi-Fi systems are fast enough that you won't notice the differences between them unless you're running a benchmark, even when you are gaming or streaming an 8K movie. 

_Note: If you are a wireless networking enthusiast, you will be able to get more performance, and perhaps match or exceed the capability of the Eero. This isn't guaranteed, though, and most people, even those who carefully read reviews, won't be able to do so. If you still get occasional Wi-Fi drops or have network issues with a non-Eero setup, the Eero will likely improve your life._

## Recommendation

Each Eero Pro 6 or Pro 6E covers 2000 sqft. The Eero Pro 6E is the newer and better version of the Eero Pro 6, and you can also get it for cheaper than the old system if you buy 2 nodes. Two nodes can cover a 4000 square foot house, which is more than enough for most people, but buy the 3-pack if your house is larger than that, as the system can reliably cover 6000 square feet.

_Note: Sometimes the price is $450, but sales occur about once a month. I don't entirely understand why._

## Budget Recommendation
The Eero 6+ is one of the very few reliable budget access points. The two-pack will cover approximately 3000 square feet. These systems can cover at most a 4500 square foot house using the very reasonably priced 3-pack.

## Setup

Just follow the app-based Eero setup wizard. It should tell you if you've set it up correctly. However, you may need to experiment a bit with the ideal places to put the access points.

For conferencing or even phone calls over Wi-Fi, having a strong signal throughout your greater work area is critical. If you like to snack in the kitchen while on a call, make sure you're getting good speeds there. To check, run several [speed tests](https://www.speedtest.net/) in each of the areas with your phone and your laptop.
