## Introduction
For reliable internet, choosing the right internet service provider and plan is critical. Unlike the other product areas, pricing is heavily dependent on location. There are areas you can get a high-speed business fiber connection for $75 per month. There are also areas where you need to pay $250 a month for business cable, just to ensure reliability. Therefore, the budget option requires spending up to $100 per month on the internet (likely a $50 marginal increase), and the recommendation is to spend up to $150 a month on the internet (a $100 marginal increase).

## Physical Connection
1. Fiber: By far the best type of connection, but rare outside of certain metro areas. If you have fiber in your area, you should be on fiber. 
2. Cable: This is much more widely available, and it's the second-best option. With cable, it can be necessary to pay for more expensive connections because everyone in your area is fighting over the same limited bandwidth (especially upload bandwidth). You need to win that fight to get reliability.
3. DSL / Satellite: Even the best examples of DSL and Satellite internet are not good fits for a work-from-home programmer. However, if you don't have access to cable and moving is not an option, you can still follow this guide.

To figure out what's available in your area, put your address in [AllConnect](https://www.allconnect.com/internet/fiber-internet). Look at the *Connection type:* under each result, and pick according to the order on the list above. This is the most important consideration, so pick your provider first.

In addition to using AllConnect, I recommend Googling: ```Fiber in {City}``` just in case the aggregator is missing a local provider.

## Business vs Residential
For all of these connections, with potentially the exception of Satellite, business internet should be available. Business internet comes with service-level agreements (SLAs) and priority and thus is more reliable. It also lets you have a static IP address, which can come in handy when interacting with legacy systems. It is especially important when on Cable or DSL because you need the priority it gives you. However, where fiber is available, business internet is generally very affordable, so it's still worth getting.

Google: ```{Provider Name} business internet``` and the page to purchase it should come up. Note you often need to sign a one-year contract for it, but it is worth it.

### Examples

These are some examples of business internet sites, just for informational purposes. Your provider almost certainly has one too.

#### Fiber

- [Google Fiber](https://fiber.google.com/business/)
- [Century Link](https://www.centurylink.com/small-business/)

#### Cable

- [Cox](https://www.cox.com/business/internet.html)
- [AT&T](https://www.att.com/smallbusiness/internet/)

## Picking a Plan
Now that you have a provider, the plan you pick depends on whether you purchased business internet. With business internet, the numbers on the plan will be more accurate, whereas with residential you should over-provision.

### Business
The minimum speed you will want to purchase is 100 Mbps down, 20 Mbps up. However, 300 Mbps down, 30 Mbps up is recommended. If you have fiber internet and can increase the upload speed, do so, as it will make everything faster and more responsive. For most people, though, that won't be an option. You can go higher than 300mbps, but generally, that's only important for recreational reasons such as downloading games or streaming multiple movies. However, if you work in a field with large file sizes such as video editing or game development, get the highest speed you can reasonably afford.

### Residential
Get the highest speed plan possible. It should not be much more than $100 per month. Having a 1 Gbps plan may sound like overkill, but you're paying for higher-priority traffic during periods of high use in your neighborhood.
