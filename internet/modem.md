## Criteria
Your modem is what converts the physical internet connection into internet access delivered over ethernet, regardless of whether you're using fiber, cable, or phone line. Modems are often complex and failure-prone electronic equipment. Cable modems are particularly sensitive, as they provide internet over an analog wire that was not originally designed to do this.

To have reliable internet, it is vital to ensure your modem is as simple and reliable as possible. Adding a router and Wi-Fi into that mix is a recipe for unreliability, as failure of any of these can cause internet failure. Therefore, no matter what type of internet connection you have, it is vital to have a standalone modem; that is, a modem that does not include a router and Wi-Fi.

What makes this an easy decision is that it will also save you money. It may surprise you to learn you are paying the internet company between $10-$15 per month to rent a crappy modem/router/Wi-Fi combo. Buying your modem, even an expensive one, will save you money in 1-2 years of service.

_Note: If in doubt, call your provider's technical support line. Especially if you have business internet, they should be able to walk you through the steps below. If you have fiber or DSL, this is more likely to be necessary._

## Cable Modem
Cable modems are some of the most common modems. Luckily, they're also the most standardized. One of the modems below is likely supported by your provider. Google ``` {provider name} supported cable modems``` and search for the model numbers. 

### Recommendation
The modem standard that cable modems follow is called DOCSIS. The latest version of this standard, and the one you should be using, TODO: MODIFY TO MENTION DOCSIS 4.0!! Any of the below will work great if compatible with your cable company. The Motorola MB8600 is likely the best, but not compatible with everyone. The Arris SURFboard is what I have, and it works great.

### Budget Recommendation
The Motorola MB7621 is a highly compatible DOCSIS 3.0 modem and is almost universally agreed as a good pick. It should be fine in most circumstances; however, I would advise the upgrade if possible to get access to the latest 3.1 standard.

## Fiber Modem
Fiber modems are not yet standardized across providers, so you'll need to do a little more research. First, Google ``` {provider name} fiber supported modems```. Then, Google each of the supported modems and find the one with the best reviews. Any fiber modem with good reviews will do. Unfortunately, many fiber providers do not let you use your own modem. (Fiber is still the vastly superior standard, so this should not affect your provider decision.) Business fiber may come with a better modem than residential, and better technical support with whom you can discuss modems.

## DSL Modem

DSL modems are only somewhat standardized, but it's critical to get a good one. The two standards to know are ADSL2+ and VDSL2+. These are the two most modern DSL standards; of the two, VDSL2+ is the fastest. Additionally, your residence may have a bonded DSL connection, i.e. two or more phone lines used to provide higher bandwidth. Not all modems support this. Finding the right modem is critical to taking advantage of these standards. Because there are fewer DSL modems, you may not be able to find one without router and Wi-Fi included.

Overall, you are limited by what your provider supports. I have not listed any DSL modems here as they often go out of production. Call the provider's tech support and ask what the fastest modem is. With business internet, you will likely have better luck.

## Modem Setup
If for whatever reason you were not able to get a standalone modem, ensure:
- Wi-Fi is disabled
- Routing is disabled

This is almost always possible from the admin page of the modem.
