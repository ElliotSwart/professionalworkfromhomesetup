## Criteria

The non-negotiable criteria for an audio solution are:
- You must be able to hear people well.
- They must be able to hear you well.
- It should not echo.
- It should be comfortable enough to use for sustained periods of time.

The secondary criterion is that it should look unobtrusive and professional.

The most reliable audio solution is earbuds with a high-quality microphone. If your ears can handle earbuds, they're almost always the best option. There are also larger headphones that provide similar functionality, but may look less professional, especially for external meetings. Finally, if you find wearing headphones or earbuds for long periods of time uncomfortable (as I do), there are a small number of conference microphones that provide good quality and noise cancellation.

## Recommendation

Far and away the best in-ear conference earbuds are Airpod Pros, which include a microphone. They work fantastically with Macs but still work well with [Windows devices](https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/how-to-pair-apple-airpods-with-your-windows-10-pc-in-less-than-a-minute/). No non-boom microphone works well in noisy environments; however, under normal conditions, your voice comes through very clearly.

One of the few acceptable speakerphones (that's actually quite fantastic) is the Anker PowerConf S500. It should be used as both the speaker and the microphone so it can perform echo cancellation. This is the way I take most of my calls. It does have a broadcast mode that increases quality, though you should only use that for recording or while wearing headphones.

## Budget Recommendation

Sadly, headsets that look decent and have good microphones are not cheap. However, at the mid-range, you can get very good audio quality.

There is no budget conference microphone that I know of that will provide sufficient quality without echoing.
