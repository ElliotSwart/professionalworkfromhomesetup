As a remote or hybrid employee, most of your interactions with your co-workers and stakeholders will likely be done over video conference. When done well, remote meetings and one-on-ones eliminate many of the inefficiencies of office life. Jumping on a quick call to talk through a technical issue or provide guidance is way easier and less disruptive than trying to arrange an impromptu in-person meeting. Additionally, being able to work with a distributed team allows you to assemble the best-suited team, regardless of location.

However, getting these gains is not a given. When done incorrectly, dynamic video meetings can turn into the soul-sucking conference calls of Dilbert comics. Bad audio caused by poor internet or insufficient hardware can lead to people talking past each other, or just pretending to understand each other to prevent repetition. Bad video caused by weird camera angles, poor internet, and/or low image quality can disrupt the sense of presence that's so important for empathy, engagement, and collaboration.

It is, therefore, necessary to optimize your setup to allow:
- Clear audio so you can hear and be heard.
- Well-lit video that allows eye contact to build a sense of presence and increase empathy.

A good conferencing setup makes you appear more professional and makes it more likely your ideas will be heard. When adopted by the majority of a team, good conference setups can help improve collaboration, camaraderie, and job satisfaction. Almost every principal engineer I've met with has a professional conference setup. You should as well!

_Note: The ability to turn your video off is fantastic. I wish I could do it in person when I'm eating a bagel. But this should be used sparingly, as there's a cost when it's done too frequently. Instead, once you've ensured you look somewhat respectable, I recommend enabling the "Hide Self" feature, which has been shown to reduce video conference fatigue._
