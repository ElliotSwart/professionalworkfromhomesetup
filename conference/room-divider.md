Not everyone has a private office in their home; most people's home offices are in bedrooms or common areas. One of the key contributors to video conference fatigue is a concern about the perceptions of the space. For $60, this is no longer an issue. Simply buy a divider that can be moved in place for meetings or during work hours.

The linked product is the cheapest and simplest that can do the job. For a bit more money, you can find one that fits your home decor.
