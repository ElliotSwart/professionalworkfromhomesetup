## Criteria

Getting good illumination for video conferencing is very helpful. It allows people to see the nuances of your facial expressions. With that said, for most people, it just needs to be good enough. Webcams have automatic algorithms that can correct discrepancies within limits. However, webcam color adjustment algorithms can be less suited for people of color, so having control over lighting can be more important (source: co-founded a color-calibrated skin imaging company).

First, there must be sufficient light. If there is not good overhead lighting, lamps will be required.

Secondly, the [color temperature](https://www.cined.com/what-is-color-temperature/) is important. It is measured in Kelvins. 2700k is warm lighting, such as that found in most homes. Studio lighting has a color temperature of 3200k. Most office lighting ranges between 3200-4000k. Aiming for 3200k is advised. However, it can be a harsher light which you may find undesirable in your home or even while working. Color-changing bulbs can give you the control to get studio lighting when needed and return to a warmer hue in the evening (or even when you leave the conference).

The first thing to do is position your desk in a place that gets good light, either from light bulbs or natural light. Then apply these recommendations from there.

## Recommendation

LiFX sells the best color-changing bulbs on the market. They have bulbs for lamps, floodlights and standard bulbs, all with very good color reproduction and control. For those who like to program in an RGB environment that looks like a laser tag arena, these bulbs can allow that but turn professional in seconds at the touch of an app.

_Note: These can be a bit of a _pain to _set up_, but_ the latest app makes it much easier._

## Budget Recommendation

You can buy 3000k LED bulbs relatively inexpensively. It provides a soft white light that should look good for conferencing without being too harsh for your home.

There are also less expensive color-changing bulbs that can let you toggle the color temperature. The one from Phillips is the most common.

## Extra Credit

If you want real studio lighting, LumeCube sells highly adjustable lights. You can control the color temperature and intensity with a lot of granularity. 
Personally, I prefer not to talk with a bright light shining in my eyes, so I stopped using my LumeCube. If you record videos or interviews often, you may find it worth the investment.
