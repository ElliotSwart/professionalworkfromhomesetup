## Criteria

Having a whiteboard is critical to brainstorming and thinking things through. If you never use a whiteboard, you may be tempted to skip this step, but now is a perfect time to change that! 

The main constraint of a whiteboard is wall space. The material can matter, but a standard whiteboard tends to work pretty well. There are plenty of whiteboards that are much more expensive, as they are made of a different material to fit specific aesthetics. These are often worse whiteboards so will not be recommended here.

## Recommendation

My fundamental recommendation is to get the largest standard whiteboard for your space.

You should always buy high-end EXPO markers because the off-brand ones are significantly worse, and the good ones cost $8.

## Budget

A small whiteboard is very affordable, and 3'x2' gives you plenty of space to write and brainstorm.

For a smaller whiteboard, you will want finer tip whiteboard markers so that you can get an equivalent level of detail that you would have with a larger whiteboard.

## Setup

Find a place off to the side of your workspace to place your whiteboard. It should be visible from your computer such that you can easily reference it or convert it into a more formal diagram/model. Ideally, it should be stably wall-mounted using standard mounting hardware (generally supplied with the whiteboard). The smaller the whiteboard, the closer it should be to where you work.

> ### What comes after whiteboarding?
> Pretty much everything you can whiteboard can be recorded and checked into version control using [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/). [Component diagrams](), [state diagrams]() and [sequence diagrams](https://plantuml.com/sequence-diagram) can be a fantastic next step in distilling what you have on your whiteboard. If you want to get really advanced with it, you can even turn it into a [checkable formal model](https://elliotswart.github.io/pragmaticformalmodeling/)
