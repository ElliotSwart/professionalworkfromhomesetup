[Supporting Research](research#large--multiple-monitors)

## Criteria

All monitors must:
- Be of sufficient size: 27-32" is generally the right size for a programming monitor. 27" is perhaps the most common. I prefer it because a 27" display is easier to twist sideways and adjust when using multiple displays.
- Be of sufficient resolution: In general, 2K (2560x1440) to 4K (TODO: what's this) is a good resolution for a 27" monitor. You likely want 4K for a 32" monitor or larger.
- Have a VESA Mount: such that they can be mounted to [monitor arms](monitor-arms).

There are additional properties of monitors, such as refresh rate and color accuracy. These tend to be nice-to-haves, not need-to-haves, for programming. 

## Recommendation

One of the best monitors for programming is the Dell UltraSharp U2723QE.

The thin bezels make it easier to have multiple monitors close together and allow them to blend in with each other. This monitor's killer feature is color calibration. All your monitors come out looking the same and producing accurate color. This is especially important for UI designers and other professions that need accurate color.

_Note: With calibrated monitors, use operating system settings to adjust color profiles, rather than monitor settings. That way everything is based on the calibrated baseline, and all your monitors will look the same. The one exception is brightness because the backlight needs to be changed, which can only be done on the monitor._

If you want a 32" monitor of this kind, Dell sells one; however, it is ridiculously expensive.

There are lots of monitors that work for this purpose. There are lots of middle-ground solutions here, but if you've got the money you can just buy 2-3 of those monitors and everything will just look right out of the box.


## Budget Recommendation

Displays are another area where you do not need to spend a ton of money to get most of the gains. Pixio PX274 is a 2K monitor with thin bezels and a VESA mount.

_Note: Most companies provide at least one monitor. To save money, incorporate that monitor as a secondary display if it's worse than the monitor you own. This way, you can get away with only owning one monitor._
