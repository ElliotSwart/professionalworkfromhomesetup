## Criteria

A chair's main impact on productivity is allowing you to sit for a sustained period while working without discomfort. A professional chair (or at least a not-unprofessional chair) can reflect well on your image. However, getting a good chair goes far beyond productivity and image.

The most important thing for a chair to do is properly support your back. This is a critical investment that, like a mattress, significantly reduces what can otherwise be serious back issues in the future. For this reason, regardless of what your company provides, I highly recommend budgeting for a good chair.

## Recommendation

The Steelcase Leap V2 is beautiful and is one of the few ways to add a splash of color to your workspace. It is widely considered to be the best chair you can buy. If you've got the funds and the desire, buy it new. Otherwise, save $800 and buy it gently used or open box.

Herman Miller Aerons are the standard high-end office chair. They are a bit less comfortable than the Leap V2, but this can come down to individual preference. They've been around forever, and VC-funded startups used to buy tons of them and then go out of business, so I'd advise buying them used. Fun fact, the association of Aeron chairs with bankruptcy is why most companies don't provide good chairs anymore.

## Budget Recommendation

The Modway EEI-757 is a comfortable enough chair that provides much more support than an average office chair. For most of my life, I used a chair like this. It's not bad, though switching to the Steelcase Leap further reduced my back strain. The largest drawback is that the build quality isn't fantastic and it might break. Make sure to use it enough during the return window to check for manufacturing defects.

In general, I would avoid overstuffed gaming chairs, unless that's the vibe for your team. With that said, some of the most reasonably priced and comfortable chairs are gaming chairs. To look professional in external meetings, I'd advise buying an inexpensive, low-profile task chair that can be kept nearby. This is not meant to be your primary chair.

## Setup

Almost all of these chairs are adjustable in height and lumbar support. Make sure to experiment with these settings to find what is most comfortable for you.

Ensure the height of your chair allows a 90 angle for your arms while typing.
