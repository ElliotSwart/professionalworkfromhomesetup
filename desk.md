## Criteria

The criteria for selecting a desk are simple:
- Ergonomics: It must allow your arms to be at a 90-degree angle while typing on your keyboard. If you find a non-adjustable desk, ensure this is the case. In practice, an adjustable desk is likely required, though luckily they're available at every price range. Be careful that the desk top is not too thick, as it could prevent you from having the desk low enough that your arms are at the correct angle.
- Work surface: Your desk must have sufficient work surface to hold everything you work with. If you consult paper manuals, work with devices, or even need to juggle multiple laptops, you'll benefit from a decently sized desk.
- Open back: It should have an open back such that a monitor stand can be clamped to it. Privacy screens might prevent you from clamping a stand to the back, but you can always cut a hole for the clamp. You can also drill mount monitor stands if attaching a stand to the back isn't an option. However, for ease of use, moving, and adjustment, I'd recommend against drilling unless you have specific constraints.

Standing desks can be great for ergonomics, and for increasing engagement in Agile Standup meetings. They also tend to be adjustable. If you get a standing desk, try to get one with a motor or at least a crank, because manually adjusting the desk constantly is an accident waiting to happen and may require too much strength. While very nice, standing desks are not required to maximize productivity, and can be skipped.


## Recommendation

I can strongly recommend the UPLIFT desk from both an ergonomic and build-quality standpoint. They also sell all the accessories you need to handle wire management for a standing desk, even if you have a desktop computer. I bought the V2-Commercial for the heck of it, but the standard V2 should fit most people's needs. For a flex space, the V2-Commercial is recommended.

Additionally, they have a TaskRabbit integration with instructions. I built my first one, I TaskRabbit-ed the second. Building it is very possible, but it might take you an hour or two. I'd say it's well worth it to pay a TaskRabbit unless you like building things (which I do, but only once due to DRY). 


## Budget Recommendation

For a budget desk, the FEZIBO is a cheaper version of the UPLIFT desk and should have many of the same benefits, including being motorized. The Sit-Stand Desk is worse but cheaper and still adjustable. It uses a manual crank for adjustments, which means it should be able to bear some weight and makes accidents less likely.

## Cable Management
A desk needs sufficient access to power. Ideally, each desk should have two power strips: one larger one located in a lower visibility area, and a smaller one easily accessible while sitting. Both of these should be secured to the desk top with screws or some other attachment mechanism. The small power strip should be wired into the larger one. All monitors and other permanent devices should be wired into the larger one. The larger power strip should have a longer cord (or at least an extension cord) and be the main wire leaving the desk.

For the UPLIFT desk, the following two products work well and should both be purchased if possible:

Additionally, if your desk is not located on a wall, or has power/ethernet that needs to traverse the floor, get a floor runner that can adhere itself to the floor to prevent tripping on, damaging, or unplugging the cables.

## Standing-Desk Setup
In almost all cases, wire management for a standing desk should be connected with the desk top itself and not the floor. Following the power management instructions above is a critical prerequisite. If you have a desktop computer, ideally it should be mounted to the desk top itself. This is likely only practical for powered desks.

The keyboard should be placed on the surface of the desk, with the monitors positioned correctly. Then, no matter if you are sitting or standing, as long as your arms are hanging at 90 degrees, your keyboard and screen will be in the right place.
